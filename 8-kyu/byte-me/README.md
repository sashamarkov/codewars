<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/636f26f52aae8fcf3fa35819/train/python target="_blank">Byte me!</a></h2><h3>8 kyu</h3><p>If I were to ask you the size of <code>"hello"</code>, what would you say?</p><p>Wait, let me rephrase the question:</p><p>If I were to ask you the <strong>total byte size</strong> of <code>"hello"</code>, how many bytes do you think it takes up?</p><p>I'll give you a hint: it's not 5.</p><pre><code>len("hello")  --&gt;  5byte size --&gt;  54</code></pre><p>54? What?!</p><p>Here's why: every string has to have an encoding (e.g ASCII),the info that makes it an object, as well as all of it's other properites... it would have to take up a bit more than 5 bytes, wouldn't it?</p><p>This might be useful for sending something over a network, where you need to represent the memory size the item takes up.</p><hr><h2 id="task">Task:</h2><p>In this kata, you need to return the number of bytes (aka. memory size) a given <code>object</code> takes up. </p><p>Different variable types will be given, but they will all be valid. Also, random generation for strings takes out of Unicode, not the regular 255 ascii letters.</p><p><em>p.s: Don't be afraid to use the internet. It "byte" come in handy :)</em></p><p><strong>Other Examples:</strong></p><pre><code>Object    Bytes    Why?----      ----     ---- "é¾˜"       76      Other character sets take up more room.123        28      Numbers don't have as much info in them. [1,2]      72      Lists have more info stored (e.g index).(1,2)      56      Tuples are (kind of) just bowls of data.</code></pre>
