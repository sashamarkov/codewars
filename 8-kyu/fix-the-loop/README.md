But there seems to be a minor mistake in the grammar, which prevents the program to work. Fix it! :)</p><p>If you pass the list of your favourite animals to the function, you should get the list of the animals with orderings and newlines added.</p><p>For example, passing in:</p><pre><code>[ "dog", "cat", "elephant" ]</code></pre><p>will result in:</p><pre><code>"1. dog\n2. cat\n3. elephant\n"</code></pre>
