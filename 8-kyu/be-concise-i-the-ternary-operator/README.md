Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of <strong>137</strong>.</p><p>I'll give you a few hints:</p><ol><li>The title itself is a hint - if you're not sure what to do, <strong>always</strong> research any terminology in this description that you have not heard of!</li><li>Don't you think the whole <code>"You're a(n) &lt;insert_something_here&gt;"</code> is very repetitive? ;)  Perhaps we can shorten it?</li><li>Write everything in one line, <code>\n</code> and other whitespaces counts.</li></ol><p><strong>Whatever you do, do not change what the function does.</strong>  Good luck :)</p>
