I cannot hit customers. I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.Alan: Yeah, chicken stock.Phil: Hello Alan.Alan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.Lynn: What do you mean?Alan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.</code></pre><p>Alan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as <code>Hotter than the sun!</code>. According to  <a href="http://www.space.com/17137-how-hot-is-the-sun.html" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">space.com</a> the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science for now. </p><h1 id="task">Task</h1><p>Your job is simple, if <code>x</code> squared is more than 1000, return <code>It's hotter than the sun!!</code>, else, return <code>Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.</code></p><p><strong>Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages).</strong></p><h1 id="other-katas-in-this-series">Other katas in this series:</h1><p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/alan-partridge-i-partridge-watch" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Alan Partridge I - Partridge Watch</a><br><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/alan-partridge-iii-london" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Alan Partridge III - London</a></p>
