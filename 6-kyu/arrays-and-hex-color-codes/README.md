These subarrays contain strings representing colors in RGB format, each string will contain one predominant color channel that is more saturated than the other two. Among all the strings in an subarray only 2 color channels will come up as predominant - the one that appears more often is "major" and the one that appears less often is "minor". Your task is to determine the major and minor colors inside each subarray and return them in the following format: <code>{Major1}+{Minor1},{Major2}+{Minor2},{Major3}+{Minor3}</code>.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>input = [  ["FFA07A", "FA8072", "8DC4DE"],  ["7FFF00", "ADFF2F", "FF0000", "00FF7F", "00FF7F"],  ["ADD8E6", "6B8E23", "9ACD32", "32CD32", "00FF00"]]result = "Red+Blue,Green+Red,Green+Blue"</code></pre><p>Explanation:</p><ul><li>first subarray's predominant colors: <code>Red</code>, <code>Red</code>, <code>Blue</code> (<code>Red</code> is major, <code>Blue</code> is minor)</li><li>second subarray's predominant colors: <code>Green</code>, <code>Green</code>, <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, <code>Green</code> (<code>Green</code> is major, <code>Red</code> is minor)</li><li>third subarray's predominant colors: <code>Blue</code>, <code>Green</code>, <code>Green</code>, <code>Green</code>, <code>Green</code> (<code>Green</code> is major, <code>Blue</code> is minor)</li></ul>
