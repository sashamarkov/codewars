Each open bracket on the left should have a corresponding closed bracket on the right. For example "(()())" is a proper sequence, "()(()" is not a proper sequence. The presence of Jokers adds an extra level of difficulty to the analysis because each "J" makes three possibilities to consider. An empty string is considered a valid string because it does not contain unbalanced brackets.</p><h1 id="examples">Examples</h1><pre><code>closed_brackets("(J))") ➞ True# J can be replaced with (closed_brackets("(") ➞ False# Unbalanced open bracket.closed_brackets("") ➞ True# Empty string is a valid sequence.closed_brackets("()J(") ➞ False# Not possible to balance the brackets.closed_brackets("J") ➞ True# J can be replaced with an empty string.closed_brackets(")(") ➞ False# Numbers of ( and ) are the same but they are in the wrong places.closed_brackets("J)(J") ➞ True# First 'J' can be replaced with '(' and second with ')'closed_brackets("()") ➞ True# A proper sequence of balanced brackets.</code></pre><h1 id="input-constraints">Input Constraints</h1><ul><li>0 &lt;= len(s) &lt;= 100</li></ul>
