A rook can only move vertically or horizontally from its current position and two rooks attack each other if one is on the path of the other. In the following figure, the dark squares represent the reachable locations for rook R<sub>1</sub> from its current position. The figure also shows that the rook R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are in attacking positions where R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are not. R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> are also in non-attacking positions.</p><p><img border="0" alt="Screenshot-2" src="https://image.ibb.co/ixj2op/Screenshot-2.png"></p><p>Now, given two numbers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, your job is to determine the number of ways one can put <code>k</code> rooks on an <code>n x n</code> chessboard so that no two of them are in attacking positions.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <code>k</code> rooks are <strong>indistinguishable</strong> / <strong>interchangeable</strong> - this means that in the above illustration, for example, swapping rook R<sub>1</sub> with rook R<sub>2</sub> does <strong>not</strong> count as a new configuration - it is just a "relabelling" of the same configuration.</p><p><strong>Range:</strong> (1 ≤ n ≤ 15) and (0 ≤ k ≤ n<sup>2</sup>)</p>
