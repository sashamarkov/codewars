The functionality should be able to be used in two methods: <code>RegExp.clone(/regex/)</code> and <code>(/regex/).clone()</code>. Just because. ;P</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: any time a regex is "run" (using match, replace, exec, etc.), its state may change such that the next time it is run, a different result is produced.</p></blockquote>
