It was fun and you learned stuff. So what else can you do but rise to the challenge when a 3-year old exclaims, "Look, I made a square!", then pointing to a pile of blocks, "Can <em>you</em> do it?"</p><h2 id="our-blocks">Our Blocks</h2><p>Just to play along, of course we'll be viewing these blocks in two dimensions. Depth now being disregarded, it turns out the pile has four different sizes of block: <code>1x1</code>, <code>1x2</code>, <code>1x3</code>, and <code>1x4</code>. The smallest one represents the area of a square, the other three are rectangular, and all differ by their width. Integers matching these four widths are used to represent the blocks in the input.</p><h2 id="the-square">The Square</h2><p>Well, the kid made a <code>4x4</code> square from this pile, so you'll have to match that. Noticing the way they fit together, you realize the structure must be built in fours rows, one row at a time, where the blocks must be placed horizontally. With the known types of block, there are five types of row you could build:</p><ol><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit bock (in either order)</li><li>2 two-unit blocks</li><li>1 two-unit block plus 2 one-unit blocks (in any order)</li><li>4 one-unit blocks</li></ol><h2 id="some-notes">Some Notes</h2><ul><li>Amounts for all four block sizes will each vary from <code>0</code> to <code>16</code>.</li><li>The total size of the pile will also vary from <code>0</code> to <code>16</code>.</li><li>A valid square doesn't have to use all given blocks.</li><li>The order of rows is irrelevant.</li></ul><h2 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h2><p>Given <code>1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2</code> there are many ways you could construct a square. Here are three possibilities, as described by their four rows:</p><p>ONE</p><ol><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>2 two-unit blocks</li><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>4 one-unit blocks</li></ol><p>TWO</p><ol><li>1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block</li><li>2 two-unit blocks</li><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>1 one-unit block plus 1 three-unit block</li></ol><p>THREE</p><ol><li>2 two-unit blocks</li><li>1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block</li><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>2 one-unit blocks plus 1 two-unit block</li></ol><p>Given <code>1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2</code> there is no way to complete the task, as you could only build three rows of the correct length. The kid will not be impressed.</p><p>NONE</p><ol><li>1 four-unit block</li><li>2 two-unit blocks</li><li>1 three-unit block plus 1 one-unit block</li><li>(here only sadness)</li></ol><h2 id="input">Input</h2><pre><code>blocks ~ array of random integers (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 4)</code></pre><h2 id="output">Output</h2><pre><code>true or false ~ whether you can build a square</code></pre><h2 id="enjoy">Enjoy!</h2><p>...and please consider one of the following kata to solve next:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5cb5eb1f03c3ff4778402099" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Four Letter Words ~ Mutations</a></li><li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c658c2dd1574532507da30b" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Crossword Puzzle!
