Because the <code>3</code> numbers are obtained by increments of <code>1</code> from the initial number of the sequence.</p><p>in <code>10 11 12 7</code> it still is <code>3</code> . Won by the subsequence <code>10 11 12</code> which is the longest sequence of number following each other incremented by the same number: <code>1</code></p><p>in <code>1 3 9</code> it is <code>2</code>. Either won by <code>1 3</code>(+2) or <code>3 9</code> (+6).</p><p>in <code>7 8 9 2 5 8 11</code> the longest chain length is <code>4</code> won by <code>2 5 8 11</code> (same increment of <code>3</code> between them)</p><p>in <code>1 3 9 15 21 7 8 2 3 4</code> result is <code>4</code> won by <code>3 9 15 21</code> (incremented by <code>6</code>)</p><p>The numbers in the chain will only be positive or negative <code>integers</code> separated by a space. </p>
